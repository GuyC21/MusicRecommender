# MusicRecommender
## You enter an album name, you receive album recommendations

You should run the code by this order:
  1. SQLiteLoading.ipynb - Read this file. here you will see all the queries we used for the project. sadly i can not attach the sqlite file itself because it is too          big, but you can find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maltegrosse/8-m-spotify-tracks-genre-audio-features
  2. MusicRecommender - here you will look for new recommended albums.

everything else that is needed should be written inside the files.

## take note
in order to use this code, you have to know how python variables work and its syntax.
