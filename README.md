# MusicRecommender
# You enter an album name, you receive album recommendations

You should run the code by this order:
  1. SQLiteLoading.ipynb - this will load the SQLite data into pandas dataframes (and some more things that will be explained in the file)
  2. MusicRecommender - here you will look for new recommended albums.
everything else should be written inside the files.

# take note
in order to use this code, you have to know how python variables work and its syntax.
